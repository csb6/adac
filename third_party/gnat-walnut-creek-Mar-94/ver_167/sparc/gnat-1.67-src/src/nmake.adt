--  This file is a template used as input to the utility program xnmake.spt

package Nmake is

--  This package contains a set of routines used to construct tree nodes
--  using a functional style. There is one routine for each node type defined
--  in Sinfo with the general interface:

--    function Make_xxx (Sloc : Source_Ptr,
--                       Field_Name_1 : Field_Name_1_Type [:= default]
--                       Field_Name_2 : Field_Name_2_Type [:= default]
--                       ...)
--    return Node_Id

--  Only syntactic fields are included (i.e. fields marked as "-Sem" or "-Lib"
--  in the Sinfo spec are excluded).

--  Default values are provided only for flag fields (where the default is
--  False), and for optional fields. An optional field is one where the
--  comment line describing the field contains the string "(set to xxx if".
--  For such fields, a default value of xxx is provided."

--  Warning: since calls to Make_xxx routines are normal function calls, the
--  arguments can be evaluated in any order. This means that at most one such
--  argument can have side effects (e.g. be a call to a parse routine).
