package Stringt is

--  This package contains routines for handling the strings table which is
--  used to store string constants encountered in the source, and also those
--  additional string constants generated by compile time concatenation and
--  other similar processing.

--  A string constant in this table consists of a series of Char_Code values,
--  so that 16-bit character codes can be properly handled if this feature
--  is implemented in the scanner.

--  There is no guarantee that hashing is used in the implementation, although
--  it maybe. This means that the caller cannot count on having the same Id
--  value for two identical strings stored separately.

   --------------------------------------
   -- String Table Access Subprograms --
   --------------------------------------

   procedure Initialize_Stringt;
   --  Initializes the strings table for a new compilation

   function Last_String_Id return String_Id;
   pragma Inline (Last_String_Id);
   --  String_Id of last currently allocated string

   procedure Start_String;
   --  Sets up for storing a new string in the table. To store a string, a
   --  call is first made to Start_String, then successive calls are
   --  made to Store_String_Character to store the characters of the string.
   --  Finally, a call to End_String terminates the entry and returns it Id.

   procedure Store_String_Char (C : Char_Code);
   --  Store next character of string, see description above for Start_String

   procedure Unstore_String_Char;
   --  Undoes effect of previous Store_String_Char call, used in some error
   --  situations of unterminated string constants.

   function End_String return String_Id;
   pragma Inline (End_String);
   --  Terminates current string and returns its Id

   function String_Length (Id : String_Id) return Int;
   pragma Inline (String_Length);
   --  Returns length of previously stored string

   function Get_String_Char (Id : String_Id; Index : Int) return Char_Code;
   --  Obtains the specified character from a stored string. The lower bound
   --  of stored strings is always 1, so the range is 1 .. String_Length (Id).

   procedure Write_String_Table_Entry (Id : String_Id);
   --  Writes a string value with enclosing quotes to the current file using
   --  routines in package Output. Does not write an end of line character.
   --  This procedure is used for debugging purposes. 7-bit ASCII graphics
   --  (except for double quote and left brace) are output literally. The
   --  double quote appears as two successive double quotes. All other codes,
   --  including the code for left brace, are output as a decimal code value
   --  enclosed in braces. For example, the string created by the folding of
   --  "A" & Ascii.LF & "Hello" will print as "A{12}Hello".

   -- Private Part Subpackage --
   -----------------------------

   --  The following package contains the definition of the data structure
   --  used by the implementation of the Strings package. Logically it really
   --  corresponds to the private part, hence the name. The reason that it
   --  is defined as a sub-package is to allow special access from clients
   --  that need to see the internals of the data structures.

   package Stringt_Private_Part is

      --  The following table stores the sequence of character codes for the
      --  stored string constants. The entries are referenced from the
      --  separate Strings table.

         Table_Name     => "String_Chars");

      --  The String_Id values reference entries in the Strings table, which
      --  contains String_Entry records that record the length of each stored
      --  string and its starting location in the String_Chars table.

         String_Index : Int;
         Length       : Int;
