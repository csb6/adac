This is the Gnat Examples Directory. Our goal is to provide the gnat user some
pieces of code that are easy to understand, easy to modify and to play with,
and which demonstrate either :
    - some classic Ada features
    - some new Ada 9x features
    - some good pedagogical programming exercises
If you are insterested in sharing your own programs with the Gnat community,
please tune them with the latest Gnat version and send it with appropriate
documentation (and bug reports) to comar@cs.nyu.edu
