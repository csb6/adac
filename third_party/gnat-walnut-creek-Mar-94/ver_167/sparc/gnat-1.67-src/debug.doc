This documentation file contains a description of the current usage of the
dynamic debug flags declared in package Debug and set in package Switch.


Options for Tree and Source Print
---------------------------------

This facility allows printing to Standard_Output of generated trees and
also of source recreated from these generated trees.

 The basic options are:

   -dt	 Print generated tree of main unit (but not withed units) after the
	 last phase (i.e. after parsing if there are parse errors or if in
	 syntax check only mode, and otherwise after semantics/expansion),

   -ds	 Print recreated source from tree of main unit (but not withed units)
	 after the last phase (i.e. after parsing if parse errors or if in
	 syntax check only mode, and otherwise after semantics/expansion),

 Additional options are:

   -du	 Print generated tree of main unit after parsing and before
	 semantics. If this is used together with -dt and semantics
	 takes place, then both trees will be separately printed

   -dw	 Print recreated source from three of main unit after parsing and
	 before semantics. If this is used together with -ds and semantics
	 takes place, then both sources will be separately printed

   -dy	 Print generated tree for package Standard after last phase

   -dz	 Print recreated source for package Standard after last phase

   -df	 Modifies the effect of -ds -dt -du -dw switches so that in
	 addition to output for the main unit, trees/sources will also
	 be output for all subsidiary units, including those directly
	 withed and those implicitly loaded.

   -dg	 Modifies the form of any recreated source printed to include
	 only the generated (rewritten) tree without any {} characters

   -do	 Modifies the form of any recreated source printed to include
	 only the original tree. Note that if expansion has taken place,
	 the expander is allowed to clobber the tree, so even with -do
	 you will see the clobbered tree.

   Note: in the absense of -dg and -do, source trees are printed with
   both the original tree before rewriting, and the rewritten generated
   tree, with sections from the latter enclosed in {} curly brackets.


Other debugging switches
------------------------

   -da	 Generate messages tracking semantic analyzer progress. A message
	 will be output as each node is analyzed, resolved or expanded.

   -dc	 List names of units as they are compiled

   -dd	 Dynamic allocation of tables messages generated. Each time one of
	 the dynamic tables (package Table) is expanded, a message is
	 generated.

   -de	 List the entity table

   -dh	 Force unit loads even in syntax only mode. This is useful in debugging
	 the basic unit loading mechanism, separate from semantic analysis.

   -di	 Generate messages for visibility linking/delinking

   -dk   Force the compiler to crash as soon as Debug_Error, Compiler_Error
         or any standard exception are raised. That is the only way to get
         a traceback, now that these exceptions are handled in the procedure
         gnat.
 
   -dl	 Generate unit load trace messages. Each time a unit load is attempted
	 a message is generated, showing the unit name, and whether the unit
	 has already been loaded.

   -dn	 Generate messages for node/list allocation. A message is generated
	 for each node or list allocated.

   -dp	 Generate messages for parser scope stack push/pops. Each time the
	 parser stack is pushed or popped, a message is generated.

   -dr	 Generate parser resynchronization messages. When one of the parser
	 resync routines in Par.Sync is called, two messages are generated
	 at the start and end of the token scan.

Debug Flag Usage for Binder
---------------------------

   -dc	 List units as they are chosen in the dependency analysis

   -dn	 List details of manipulation of Num_Pred values used in the
	 dependency analysis
