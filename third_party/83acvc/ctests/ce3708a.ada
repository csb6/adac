-- CE3708A.ADA

-- OBJECTIVE:
--     CHECK THAT INTEGER_IO PUT RAISES LAYOUT_ERROR WHEN THE MINIMUM
--     WIDTH REQUIRED FOR THE OUTPUT VALUE IS GREATER THAN THE LENGTH
--     OF THE STRING.  ALSO CHECK THAT INTEGER_IO PUT PADS THE OUTPUT
--     ON THE LEFT WITH SPACES IF THE LENGTH OF THE STRING IS GREATER
--     THAN THE MINIMUM WIDTH REQUIRED.

-- HISTORY:
--     SPS 10/05/82
--     CPP 07/30/84
--     JLH 09/11/87  ADDED CASES FOR PADDING OF OUTPUT STRING.
