-- C35708B.DEP

-- OBJECTIVE:
--     CHECK THAT UNNORMALIZED MODEL NUMBERS ARE CORRECT
--     FOR DIGITS = 6.

-- APPLICABILITY CRITERIA:
--     THIS TEST IS APPLICABLE TO IMPLEMENTATIONS WHICH
--     SUPPORT DIGITS = 6.
--
--     IF DIGITS = 6 IS NOT SUPPORTED, THEN THE DECLARATION OF
--     DN MUST BE REJECTED.

-- HISTORY:
--     BAW 09/80     CREATED ORIGINAL TEST.
--     JBG 10/29/82
