-- CHECK THAT A RECORD VARIABLE CONSTRAINED BY A SPECIFIED DISCRIMINANT
-- VALUE CANNOT HAVE ITS DISCRIMINANT VALUE ALTERED BY ASSIGNMENT.  
-- ASSIGNING AN ENTIRE RECORD VALUE WITH A DIFFERENT DISCRIMINANT VALUE
-- SHOULD RAISE CONSTRAINT_ERROR AND LEAVE THE TARGET VARIABLE 
-- UNALTERED.  THIS TEST USES STATIC DISCRIMINANT VALUES.
