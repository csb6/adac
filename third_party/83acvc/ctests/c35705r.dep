-- C35705R.DEP

-- OBJECTIVE:
--     CHECK THAT LARGE, SMALL, AND EPSILON CAN BE ASSIGNED EXACTLY
--     FOR DIGITS = 22.

-- APPLICABILITY CRITERIA:
--     THIS TEST IS APPLICABLE TO IMPLEMENTATIONS WHICH
--     SUPPORT DIGITS = 22.
--
--     IF DIGITS = 22 IS NOT SUPPORTED, THEN THE DECLARATION OF TYPE
--     DN MUST BE REJECTED.

-- HISTORY:
--     BAW 09/80     CREATED ORIGINAL TEST.
--     JBG 10/29/82
--     JBG 10/12/86  ADDED CODE TO CHECK THAT VALUES ARE TREATED
--                   CORRECTLY AT COMPILE-TIME (BY OPTIMIZING
--                   COMPILERS); REMOVED -B FROM NAME.
--     BCB 01/06/88  MODIFIED HEADER.
