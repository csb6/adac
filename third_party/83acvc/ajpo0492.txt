             LIFE OF ACVC 1.11 VALIDATION SUITE EXTENDED

The following announcement was made April 14, 1992, by Dr. John Solomond, 
Director, Ada Joint Program Office (AJPO).

In December 1990, I announced my intention to freeze the Ada Compiler 
Validation Capability (ACVC) on version 1.11 for ANSI/MIL-STD 1815A 
(ISO/8652-1987 and FIPS 119, 1985).  During 1991, I have heard arguments for 
and against issuing a "maintained" version of ACVC 1.11.  I have concluded 
that the original "freeze" policy is in the best interest of Ada users, 
vendors, and the Ada 9X Project.

Holders of current ACVC 1.11 certificates will soon receive a replacement 
certificate from the AJPO -- which shows an expiration date of ANSI/MIL-STD 
1815B + 24 months.  This expiration "date" means that the validated status of 
an ACVC 1.11 compiler will be retained until two years after Ada 9X has been 
adopted by ANSI.  The ACVC version 1.11 will expire one year before 
certificates (i.e., 12 months after ANSI Ada 9X adoption) as has been the 
practice.  This extended life for ACVC 1.11 means that there will be an 
overlap period between ACVC 1.11 (for ANSI/MIL-STD 1815A validations) and ACVC 
2.0 (for ANSI/MIL-STD 1815B validations).  Some compiler vendors may decide to 
skip ACVC 2.0 and put all their resources into validating Ada 9X compilers 
with the more complete ACVC version 2.1.

A "freeze" on ACVC version 1.11 means that test programs may be withdrawn but 
there will be no additions, modifications, or re-issue of an ACVC version that 
measures conformity with ANSI/MIL-STD 1815A.  The next ACVC version issued 
will be Ada 9X Basic, but it will be only for informational purposes.  The Ada 
9X Transition Plan provides more information on the Ada 9X ACVC versions that 
will be used to obtain Ada 9X validation certificates.

I believe this policy provides benefits not only for Ada compiler vendors but 
for users of Ada 83 compilers who can't wait for Ada 9X.  By reducing 
validation costs now, compiler vendors should be able to fine-tune the 
performance of Ada 83 compilers and to provide the robust tools that existing 
Ada projects need to cost-effectively maintain applications.  I want to see 
software project managers make a quick transition to the use of Ada 9X, but I 
also recognize that the benefits of software engineering with Ada should not 
be postponed until Ada 9X compilers are available.  I am counting on DoD 
software managers to create a robust Ada market for high performance compilers 
and tools for Ada 83 and for Ada 9X.  I am counting on Ada vendors to respond 
to the relief from validation costs during this transition period with high 
quality conforming products.
