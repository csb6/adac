-- '$'FIXED_NAME IS A PRE-DEFINED FIXED POINT TYPE OTHER THAN DURATION.
-- IF THERE IS ANOTHER PREDEFINED FIXED POINT TYPE, THEN THIS UNIT WILL
-- REPLACE THE PREVIOUSLY COMPILED AVAT014.

-- REPLACE THE MACRO SYMBOL '$'FIXED_NAME WITH THE NAME OF A PREDEFINED
-- FIXED POINT TYPE OTHER THAN DURATION.  IF THERE IS MORE THAN ONE SUCH
-- TYPE, THEN FOR EACH, INSERT A VARIABLE DECLARATION SIMILAR TO THE
-- DECLARATION OF X1, AND MAKE APPROPRIATE SUBSTITUTIONS IN LINE2,
-- LINE3, LINE4, AND LINE5.  IF THERE IS NO SUCH PREDEFINED FIXED POINT
-- TYPE, MAKE NO SUBSTITUTIONS.

-- CHECK WHETHER OTHER PREDEFINED FIXED TYPES ARE SUPPORTED.

-- TBN 11/18/87  CREATED ORIGINAL TEST.
