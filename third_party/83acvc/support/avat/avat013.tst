-- AVAT013.TST

-- '$'FLOAT_NAME IS A PRE-DEFINED FLOATING POINT TYPE OTHER THAN FLOAT,
-- SHORT_FLOAT, AND LONG_FLOAT.  IF THERE IS ANOTHER PREDEFINED FLOATING
-- POINT TYPE, SUCH AS SHORT_SHORT_FLOAT OR LONG_LONG_FLOAT, THEN THIS
-- UNIT WILL REPLACE THE PREVIOUSLY COMPILED AVAT012.

-- REPLACE THE MACRO SYMBOL '$'FLOAT_NAME WITH THE NAME OF A PREDEFINED
-- FLOATING POINT TYPE OTHER THAN FLOAT, SHORT_FLOAT, OR LONG_FLOAT.  IF
-- THERE IS MORE THAN ONE SUCH TYPE, THEN FOR EACH, INSERT A VARIABLE
-- DECLARATION SIMILAR TO THE DECLARATION OF X1, AND MAKE APPROPRIATE
-- SUBSTITUTIONS IN LINE2, LINE3, LINE4, AND LINE5.  IF THERE IS NO SUCH
-- PREDEFINED FLOATING POINT TYPE, MAKE NO SUBSTITUTIONS.

-- CHECK WHETHER OTHER PREDEFINED FLOATING TYPES ARE SUPPORTED.
