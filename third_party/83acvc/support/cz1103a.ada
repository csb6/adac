-- CZ1103A.ADA

-- OBJECTIVE:
--     CHECK THAT THE PROCEDURE CHECK_FILE WORKS CORRECTLY, IN
--     PARTICULAR, THAT IT WILL REPORT INCORRECT FILE CONTENTS
--     AS TEST FAILURES.

--     THIS TEST INTENTIONALLY CONTAINS MISMATCHES BETWEEN FILE
--     CONTENTS AND THE 'CONTENTS' STRING PARAMETER OF PROCEDURE
--     CHECK_FILE.

-- PASS/FAIL CRITERIA:
--     AN IMPLEMENTATION PASSES THIS TEST IF TEST EXECUTION REPORTS THE
--     FOLLOWING FOUR FAILURES, REPORTS AN INTERMEDIATE "FAILED" RESULT,
--     REPORTS A FINAL "TENTATIVELY PASSED" RESULT, AND REPORTS NO
--     OTHER FAILURES.
--        * CZ1103A FROM CHECK_FILE: END OF LINE EXPECTED - E
--                     ENCOUNTERED.
--        * CZ1103A FROM CHECK_FILE: END_OF_PAGE NOT WHERE EXPECTED.
--        * CZ1103A FROM CHECK_FILE: END_OF_FILE NOT WHERE EXPECTED.
--        * CZ1103A FROM CHECK_FILE: FILE DOES NOT CONTAIN CORRECT
--                      OUTPUT - EXPECTED C - GOT I.

-- HISTORY:
--     SPS 12/09/82  CREATED ORIGINAL TEST.
--     JRK 11/18/85  ADDED COMMENTS ABOUT PASS/FAIL CRITERIA.
--     JET 01/13/88  UPDATED HEADER FORMAT, ADDED FINAL CALL TO
--                   SPECIAL_ACTION.
--     PWB 06/24/88  CORRECTED PASS/FAIL CRITERIA TO INDICATE THE
--                   EXPECTED RESULT (TENTATIVELY PASSED).
