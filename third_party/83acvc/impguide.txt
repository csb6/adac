              Ada COMPILER VALIDATION CAPABILITY (ACVC) 
                 IMPLEMENTERS' GUIDE AND USER's GUIDE

With acceptance of Ada 9X (now Ada 95) as an International Standard, there are 
two Ada validation test suites current -- one for the 1983 version of Ada 
(ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A), and one for Ada 95 (ISO/IEC 8652:1995).

The current version of the validation test suite for Ada 83 is version 1.11 of 
the Ada Compiler Validation Capability (ACVC).  The current version of the 
validation test suite for Ada 95 is ACVC 2.0.

For those who wish to use ACVC 1.11, the "Ada Compiler Validation Capability 
Implementers' Guide" is available; for those who wish to use ACVC 2.0, the 
"Ada Compiler Validation Capability (ACVC) Version 2.0 User's Guide" is 
available.

Both documents are available for downloading from the Ada Information 
Clearinghouse's host computer (sw-eng.fall-schurch.va.us) on the Internet.

Additionally, hardcopies of the Implementers's Guide for ACVC 1.11 are 
available through the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC) and the 
National Technical Information Service (NTIS), which sells to the general 
public.  (See below.)
